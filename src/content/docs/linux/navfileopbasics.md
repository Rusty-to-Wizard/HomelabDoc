Navigation basics:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory              # Change directory
cd ..                              # Go up one directory
ls                                 # List files
ls -l                              # List with details
ls -a                              # List all (including hidden)
pwd                                # Print working directory
```

File peration basics:

```bash
cp file.txt /destination/          # Copy file
cp -r folder/ /destination/        # Copy directory recursively
mv file.txt newname.txt            # Rename/move file
rm file.txt                        # Delete file (careful!)
rm -rf folder/                     # Delete folder (VERY careful!)
mkdir -p path/to/nested/folder     # Create nested directories
touch file.txt                     # Create empty file or update timestamp
```

Using these commands everyday - while trying my best not to use GUI - has helped me solidify the absolute basics of using the terminal. It's quite fun :)
