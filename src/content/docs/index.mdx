# About Me

I got started in homelab all becaused of HDD that shorted my main PC back in Sept 2025. I was a long time Windows user before that, with occasional on/off relationship with Linux OS throughout the years. It was only this year I only fully switch to Linux due to Windows' forcing my PC to update to Windows 11 along with Copilot enabled. I later found out a term for this: "Enshittification". Along with my main computer running on CachyOS, my server runs on Ubuntu Server, it has given me a lot of sense of control back in my life, reminding me why I love IT and technology: being able to mess about, configure, strip it all down & rebuild back up to how exactly I wanted it to be. This is why I like going forward into Linux Sysadmin path.
