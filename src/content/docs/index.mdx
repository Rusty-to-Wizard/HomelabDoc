# About Me

I got started in homelab all because of an HDD that shorted my main PC back in Sept 2025 - I lost well over 15 years' worth of data/memories. That kick started me into self-hosting. And at the same time I was a long-time Windows user having experimented in dual booting Linux OS throughout the years. It was only this year I fully switched to Linux due to Windows' forcing my PC to update to Windows 11 along with Copilot enabled. I later found out the term for this: "Enshittification". Along with my main computer running on CachyOS, my server runs on Ubuntu Server, it has given me a lot of sense of control back in my life, reminding me why I love IT and technology: being able to mess about, configure, strip it all down & rebuild back up to how exactly I wanted it to be. This is why I like going forward into Linux Sysadmin path.
